--Projects Ideas--

"Hard" 1) Create ASCII art from photo
	(found a PNG to JPG converter in python I could work with to
	incorporate for error prevention)

"Intermediate" 2) Dice rolling simulator
	(D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20 for my sons D&D with
	 GUI if my time and skill allows)

"Easy" 3) Desktop Calculator
